# Introduction to Web Development in a Server Environment

## Submission

Submit both projects, as well as a report containing screenshots of the entire process, explaining what is being done at each step. The report must include:

* Cover page.
* Table of contents.
* Explanatory text (well-written) and screenshots.
* Possible issues encountered.
* Documentation on the use of different resources available as an annex, if applicable (for example, the use of a chatbot to translate from Spanish to English).

## Exercise 1: Static Website with VSC

Create a Spring Boot project using the VSC assistant or the IntelliJ assistant. Include the dependencies starter spring-Web, starter-Thymeleaf, and DevTools, in Java 25, packaged as a jar. Configure it to listen on port 9000 and to only contain an index.html page with the heading "Hello World". Run the application and verify in the browser that it works correctly.

## Exercise 2: Static Website with start.spring.io

Create a second project using [https://start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io) with the same features as the previous one. In this case, it will consist of a static website about Frédéric Chopin.

* **index.html** with a general biography (you can extract information from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Chopin) and summarize it). Include details about his birth and death, as well as the places where he carried out his professional activity. Talk about his partner George Sand and his time in Mallorca, as well as any other important or curious information.
* **repertorio.html** with a list of the composer’s most relevant works. Add links to selected sheet music available on [imslp.org](https://imslp.org/wiki/Category:Chopin,_Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric), as well as video performances on YouTube or IMSLP for each piece.
* **galeria-imagenes.html** with relevant photos and paintings. You can extract them from Wikipedia.
* **enlaces-externos.html** with relevant links for the website. You may add links to his Wikipedia page, imslp.org, as well as any articles you find online.

The page content can be in Spanish, although you may use a chatbot or a translator to translate it into English.
